# My Diary 2.0

### A Serious Application for Not-So-Serious Thoughts

My Diary 2.0 is a refined, vintage-themed personal journaling application built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase. It allows users to document their thoughts, track their moods, and romanticize their life like a 19th-century novelist with Wi-Fi.

## Features

**Vintage Aesthetic**
Because your thoughts deserve to look like they were written by candlelight, not in a Google Doc.

**Mood Tracking**
Log your emotional state so future-you can ask, “Why was I like this?”

**Memory Drawer**
Pin important entries. Forget the rest. Selective nostalgia is encouraged.

**Search & Filter**
Find old entries by mood, date, or emotional damage level.

**Ambient Sounds**
Rain, fireplace, and typewriter noises to make your overthinking cinematic.

**Customization**
Change your name, theme, and overall vibe. Character development, but digital.
